"""
In this code, you first set up the Vertex AI client by initializing it with your project ID and location. Then you create a batch prediction job by calling aiplatform.BatchPredictionJob.create(), passing in the job display name, model name, input and output configurations, dedicated resources, batch size, and any additional parameters you want to pass to your model.

Once you've set up the batch prediction job, you can start it by calling batch_prediction_job.run(sync=True). Setting sync=True ensures that the job runs synchronously, meaning that the function won't return until the job has completed. If you set sync=False instead, the function will return immediately and you can check the status of the job later by calling batch_prediction_job.refresh().

'''In this example, the logging library is used to create a logger named vertexai_logger, which has its logging level set to logging.INFO.
 The vertexai.log.StreamHandler handler is added to the logger, which will send log messages to Vertex AI. 
 Two log messages are sent using the logger.info method, one at the start of the batch prediction process and one at the end, 
 to capture the relevant events.'''
